🌫️ Frosted Glass Container

Semi-transparent background with a frosted glass effect.
High blur (background details visible but diffused).
Opacity ~70-80%, allows soft visibility of forest/mist scenery behind.
Subtle color absorption from background (deep gray-green hues).
Rounded capsule shape with smooth edges.
🎨 Color & Gradient

Base color: dark gray with slight blue undertones.
Center is slightly brighter than edges (light vignette effect).
Each button features internal gradients for depth:
Selected: Brighter radial center.
Unselected: Darker and more recessed.
Smooth transitions between segments, mimicking physical buttons.
🧿 Shadow & 3D Depth

Drop shadows below the entire control bar, softly cast downward.
Buttons have their own ambient shadows, enhancing separation.
Inset shadows inside the segmented control add curvature and tactile depth.
Uses neumorphism-inspired techniques without overdoing realism.
🔘 Circular Buttons

Located on left (Sort) and right (Dismiss).
Perfect circles with slight gloss and pillowy depth.
Radial highlights mimic top-left directional light source.
Icons:
Sort: Up/down arrows, centered, flat white.

📊 Segmented Control (Years / Months / All)

Capsule-style group of 3 pill buttons embedded in the bar.
Selected tab ("Years"):
Slightly brighter, lifted, flat white text.
Unselected tabs ("Months", "All"):
Softer gray text, visually recessed.
Seamless interaction feel; suggests pressable, tactile UI.
💡 Environmental Integration

Background is a misty forest with visible light rays.
Light ray from top-right informs gloss direction and ambient reflection.
The UI bar feels embedded into the scene, not layered above it.
Matches Apple’s modern “immersive layering” aesthetic.
➖ Gesture Handle

Thin white horizontal line centered at the very bottom.
Flat, matte, no shadow — minimalistic and native to iOS.
Visually distinct from the floating bar above it.
